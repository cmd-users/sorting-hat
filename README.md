üî∞ Sorting Hat is a tool that empowers students to find their best suited learning methodology, backed up by extensive research and well known psycology concepts.

üßë‚Äçüíª It uses the powers of predictive language models to interpret a series of open-ended answers so that all the relevant information is extracted to be used with traditional learning methodoly identification approaches.

üìä Sorting Hat can also be used by institutions to identify the profiles of each freshman student and organize them into classes that share a similar learning methodology to optimize teacher eficiency by using the best suited approach for that class.

## Hosting
To be able to host a Sorting Hat server you will need:
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
* [Diesel CLI](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started),
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/),
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
* and access to a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/).

<br><h3 align="center">1. Setup</h3>

1. Sorting Hat requires the Nighly version of rust, so you need to install it if not present:
```command
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

2. In the project directory you'll need to run 
```command
rustup override set nightly
```

3. To install `diesel_cli` with postgres support:
```command
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

<br><h3 align="center">2. Environment</h3>

1. To be able to run Sorting Hat on your machine, Docker must be enabled or active.  

* **On windows:** this can be done by [ensuring that the Docker icon is present at your system tray](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#start-docker-desktop).

* **On Unix:** you can [start the Docker Daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/start/) before running Sorting Hat with the command:

```command
sudo systemctl start docker
```

... or configure it to [always start at boot](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot-with-systemd) with:

```command
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
```

2. You will also need a PostgreSQL connection and provide the credentials to the program via the `.env` file.

<br><h3 align="center">3. Run</h3>

1. With everything set-up, run [`run.sh`](run.sh) (On Linux or MacOS) or [`run.bat`](run.bat) (On Windows) to start the server.
* Unix:
```command
./run.sh
```

* Windows:
```command
./run.bat
```
