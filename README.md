Sorting Hat is a tool that empowers students to find their best suited learning methodology, backed up by extensive research and well known psycology concepts.

It uses the powers of predictive language models to interpret a series of open-ended answers so that all the relevant information is extracted to be used with traditional learning methodoly identification approaches.

Sorting Hat can also be used by institutions to identify the profiles of each freshman student and organize them into classes that share a similar learning methodology to optimize teacher eficiency by using the best suited approach for that class.
